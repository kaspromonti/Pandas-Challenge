# Hello VBA

## Instructions

* Create and execute a VBA script that generates three pop-up messages with text contained therein.

* If you finish early, ensure the people around you complete the task as well.

# Choose Your Button

## Instructions

* Create an Excel file with two interactive buttons. These buttons should each be associated with a different VBA subroutine. When clicked, each button should trigger a different pop-up message.

* If you finish early, ensure the people around you complete the task as well.

# Chess Board

## Instructions

* Populate the Chess Board provided with text-based chess pieces. For the top-half of the chess board use Ranges, for the bottom-half of the chess board use Cells.

## Hint

* Remember that with `Ranges`, it is possible to modify multiple cells at once.

# Calculator

## Instructions

* Using the Spreadsheet and Unsolved VBS code as a starter, complete the script such that `Price`, `Tax`, `Quantity`, and `Total` are stored in variables.

* These variables should be then assigned the value of the cell they are associated with in the spreadsheet.

* When finished, your code should set the `Total` value in the spreadsheet and print a message box with the total in the form of: "Your total is $45.00"

## Bonus

* Try to complete the exercise, _without_ looking at the starter code.

# Sentence Breaker

## Instructions

* Using the files provided as a starting point, create a VBA script such that it reads in a User Sentence then prints the correct words based on word numbers provided.

## Notes

* This is a more challenging assignment. So take your time on it. Try to bite it off bit by bit.

# Choose Your Story

## Instructions

* Create a simple Excel workbook and VBA macro in which a user is provided a single button to click. Based on the number they provide in a text box above, a different message box will appear.

  * If the user enters a value of 1, display: “You choose to enter the wooded forest of doom!”

  * If the user enters a value of 2, display: “You choose to enter the fiery volcano of doom!”

  * If the user enters a value of 3, display: “You choose to enter the terrifying jungle of doom!”

  * If the user enters a value of 4, display a similar custom message.

  * If the user enters anything else, display: “Try following directions”
