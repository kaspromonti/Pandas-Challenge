# 1. Budget Checker

## Instructions

* Create a VBA Script to complete the budget checker.

* There are three parts to this problem.

  * Part 1: Calculate the total after fees and enter the value in the "Total" cell.

  * Part 2: Create a Message Box for the user to designate whether the amount including fees is within or over budget.

  * Part 3 (Challenge): If the total is over budget, correct the price such that it fits within the max of the user's budget. Be sure to round down! (Example: If the user's budget is 100 and the fees are 15%, the max price should 86)

## Hints

* Break up the problem into smaller steps.

* Look at old code!

* You got this!

# 2.Looping on through

Now it's your chance to see how quickly we can create data utilizing the power of a computer and FOR loops!

## Instructions

* Create a `For` loop that will produce the following example. The lines signify new cells.

|  A | B  |  C |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| I will eat | 11 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 12 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 13 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 14 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 15 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 16 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 17 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 18 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 19 | Chicken Nuggets |
| I will eat | 20 | Chicken Nuggets |

## Bonus

* If you finish early, talk to your neighbor about why you may want to use a For loop in preference to the "range" function.


# 3. Fizz Buzz

## Instructions

* Create a VBA Script that populates the second column with the word "Fizz", "Buzz", or "Fizzbuzz" based on the value in the first column.

  * If the value in column 1 is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "Fizzbuzz" in column 2.

  * If the value in column 1 is a multiple of just 3, print "Fizz" in column 2.

  * If the value in column 1 is a multiple of just 5, print "Buzz" in column 2.

## Hints

* You are in charge of finding our winners for a local lotto drawing.

  * The results are, in order:

    * First: 3957481
    * Second: 5865187
    * Third: 2817729

  * Create a script that will return those lucky winners and print them on the sheet.

    * For each winner include the following pieces of information:

      * First name
      * Last name
      * The winning number

    * They should be placed in winning order of First, Second, Third.

    * There should also be a message box that congratulates the first place winner.

## Bonus

* There may just be one other winner! The below numbers are Wild Lotto Balls. Whichever comes up first in the list will be the fourth place (runner-up) winner.

  * 2275339
  * 5868182
  * 1841402

## Hint

* Remember to utilize variables to keep your code clean.

* For the bonus, you may need to use `Exit For`

# 5.Hornets Nest

## Instructions

* Create a VBA script to handle the growing Hornet infestation in your spreadsheet.

* There are three parts to this problem:

  * Part I: Count the number of Hornets found and display the number to your user in the form of a message box.

  * Part II: Modify the script such that it changes the word Hornets to "Bugs".

  * Part III: Modify the script a third time, this time keeping in mind that you have a limited number of Bugs and Bees. Use the full set of Bugs and Bees you have available to replace the Hornets. If you run out of Bugs or Bees provide the user with the message: "Oh no! We still have hornets..."

## Hints

* You may want to create a backup of your spreadsheet as your macro will write over the contents.

* Take lots of deep breaths!
